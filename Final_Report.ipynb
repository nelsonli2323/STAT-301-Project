    "Understanding which types of customers are more likely to engage with marketing campaigns is a importatn question in consumer analytics. Businesses invest substantial resources into customer research to help guide campaign targeting, yet it is not always clear which factors are most strongly associated with customer engagement. The [Customer Personality Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis/data) provides rich demographic and behavioural information which can be used to explore these associations in a statistical way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyze a marketing campaign dataset containing information on customer demographics, past purchasing behaviour, and previous campaign participation. Our goal is to investigate how these characteristics relate to the likelihood of responding to the company's most recent marketing campaign. Since the data come from an observational setting, our focus is on identifying associations, rather than drawing causal conclusions about the effect of any variable on campaign response.\n",
    "\n",
    "To guide our analysis, we consider the broad question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What customer characteristics (demograpahic information, purchasing  behaviour, and past campaign engagement) are associated with responding to the company's most recent marketing campaign?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing this question requires fitting multipe logistic regression models using a common binary response variable (`Repsonse`) and a set of demographic and behavioural covariates. Since the primary goal of this analysis is inference, we seek to understand which characteristics show statistically significant associations with campaign response. These insight can support bussiness in making data-driven marketing decisions."
