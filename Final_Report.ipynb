Indicate if the primary goal is inference or prediction. Make sure that the question(s) can be answered with the data available. For example, you won't be able to quantify the \"effect of X on Y\" or \"the influence of X on Y\" or \"how X affects Y\" using the methods learned in class and observational data.\n",
